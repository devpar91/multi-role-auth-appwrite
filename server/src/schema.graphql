# multi-role-auth-appwrite/server/src/schema.graphql

# A schema is a collection of type definitions (hence "typeDefs")
# that together define the "shape" of queries that are executed against
# your data.

# This "Item" type defines the queryable fields for every salable item in our data source.
type Item {
  name: String
  price: String
  description: String
  seller: String
}

type SellerListing {
  name: String
  price: String
  description: String
}

# The "Query" type is special: it lists all of the available queries that
# clients can execute, along with the return type for each.
# In this case, the "allItems" query returns an array of zero or more salable Items (defined above).
# and the sellerListings query returns an array of zero or more of seller's listed items on their account.
type Query {
  allItems: [Item]
  sellerListings: [SellerListing]
}
